# Summary

StakeWise v3 is a liquid-staking protocol that lets users stake ETH and earn rewards while keeping their assets liquid. It tokenizes staking positions into transferable ERC-20–compatible tokens and introduces a modular “vault” architecture that allows anyone , from individuals to DAOs, to create custom staking strategies under unified security and accounting rules.

# Ratings

## Chain

Stakewise V3 is deployed on Ethereum and Gnosis. This review is based on the Ethereum mainnet deployment.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

StakeWise v3 relies on a range of upgradeable components, both at the bytecode level and through owner-controlled configuration parameters. Several contracts, such as the vault implementations, the OsToken suite, the Keeper, and the various factories, are deployed behind upgradeable proxy patterns or expose administrative entry points allowing their logic to be replaced. The entities with upgrade permissions (primarily the StakeWise DAO multisig, the Stakewise Multisig #1, and #2) therefore retain the ability to modify how core mechanisms behave, including the handling of deposits, redemptions, reward accounting, validator assignments and the overall minting and burning logic for OsToken.

In addition to full logic upgrades, a large number of parameter changes can be performed without modifying bytecode. These parameters include fee destinations, blocklist administration, validator roots, keeper thresholds, reward delays, liquidation settings, vault capacities, the controller of OsToken, and the set of redeemable positions in the redeemer. Because these parameters influence how assets flow through the system, how user positions evolve over time and how rewards are computed or distributed, changes made through these permissions can materially alter the behaviour users experience, even if the underlying logic contracts remain the same.

The upgrade keys are held by a small set of actors, mainly the StakeWise DAO multisig (controlling OsToken, VaultController, VaultsRegistry, and Keeper), and Stakewise Multisig #1 (controlling the Redeemer, MerkleDistributor, and MetaVaultFactory). Additionally, a dedicated 2-of-4 Blocklist Manager handles daily censorship permissions, though its authority is granted by Stakewise Multisig #2. These roles are able to enact upgrades or parameter changes without enforced delays at the protocol layer. As a result, the entities controlling these keys can, at any moment, replace logic contracts or adjust parameters affecting how vault shares are minted or burned, how assets are redeemed, how validators are assigned, how blocklists are managed and how rewards are distributed.

These permissions mean that upgrades can directly influence both the handling of user funds and the treatment of unclaimed staking rewards. Logic upgrades to vaults or controllers can modify withdrawal or redemption behaviour. Changes to validator roots or key managers can reassign the staking infrastructure associated with user deposits. Adjustments to liquidation or redemption configuration can affect how OsToken positions settle. Administrative control over fee settings, treasury recipients and reward distribution parameters can alter how yield flows through the system. In multiple cases, an incorrect or hostile upgrade would allow the responsible administrator to redirect assets, obstruct withdrawals or modify redemption terms in ways that affect users’ positions.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

StakeWise v3 operates through several external and internal dependencies that influence its behaviour and determine how user funds and rewards are handled. These dependencies include the validator infrastructure managed by privileged entities, the oracle system feeding validator and reward data into the Keeper, and the multi-sig actors controlling key components such as vault implementations, OsToken parameters, the Redeemer, the MerkleDistributor and registry contracts. Because these dependencies provide inputs that the protocol relies on to recognise staking rewards, assign validators, process redemptions and compute vault accounting, their actions directly shape the system’s ongoing operation.

The Keeper contract obtains validator and reward data from a set of approved oracle addresses. The StakeWise DAO multisig determines which oracles participate and how many signatures are required. Any incorrect reporting or coordinated failure of these oracles would affect the accounting of rewards and the system’s view of validator status. Similarly, validator management depends on the keysManager role, the validator root, deposit data registries and the infrastructure operators securing the underlying validators. These actors determine where user stake is deposited and how exited assets are handled. If these dependencies do not behave as expected, user funds or their associated rewards can be misdirected or become inaccessible.

The protocol further depends on the behaviour of the multisigs controlling OsToken, VaultController, VaultsRegistry, the Redeemer and the MerkleDistributor. These entities may update parameters or logic that influence the solvency and redemption mechanics of OsToken, the whitelisting of vault factories and implementations, the composition of redeemable asset baskets and the distribution timing of staking rewards. Their actions therefore form part of the protocol’s operational dependencies and can materially influence how users interact with the system and how their positions evolve.

These dependencies hold meaningful influence over both principal and yield. Changes or failures in validator operators, oracle sets or the multisigs controlling critical configuration can affect how the system accounts for staking activity, how vaults process redemptions and how OsToken positions settle. Because these dependencies have direct pathways to alter or interfere with the treatment of user funds, StakeWise v3 relies on actors whose behaviour can materially affect both custody and performance.

> Autonomy score: High

## Exit Window

StakeWise v3 does not enforce mandatory execution delays or time-locked upgrade procedures at the protocol level. The entities controlling upgrade-related permissions, such as the StakeWise DAO multisig, the Stakewise Multisig #1 and #2, are able to modify logic contracts or adjust privileged parameters without a built-in waiting period that would give users time to react, migrate or redeem assets before changes take effect.

As a result, there is no built-in waiting period that would provide users with an opportunity to react, migrate, or redeem assets before changes take effect. While the oracle system may possess operational fallbacks (such as a 24h delay for missing reports), these do not constrain the governance entities' ability to enact instantaneous upgrades to the core protocol logic.

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

StakeWise v3 can be accessed primarily through the official StakeWise user interface, which enables deposits, vault interactions, OsToken minting and redemption workflows. In addition to this interface, the protocol exposes all core functionality directly through on-chain contracts, allowing users or integrators to interact without relying on a single frontend.

Crucially, the protocol provides an open-source SDK and a public vault-interface repository, which serves as a backup solution that allows users to locally host or deploy their own interface if the official website becomes unavailable. While the official interface remains the dominant access point, these tools—combined with the ability to submit transactions via block explorers guarantee that access to user positions is not dependent solely on the availability of the main domain.

> Accessibility score: Medium

## Conclusion

StakeWise v3 receives High scores in the Upgradeability, Autonomy, and Exit Window dimensions. This classifies the protocol as Stage 0.

The protocol could transition to Stage 1 by introducing a governance structure that enforces a mandatory exit window of at least seven days for all upgrades or parameter changes that affect user positions. To achieve this, the "instant upgrade" powers currently held by the Multisigs would need to be revoked or transferred to a time-locked contract, potentially reserving immediate intervention capabilities strictly for a dedicated Security Council handling provable emergencies.

Progress toward Stage 2 would require minimizing reliance on privileged multisigs and external operators to the point where dependencies no longer hold direct influence over user funds. This would involve migrating key components to fully on-chain governance with 30-day delay periods, decentralizing the oracle and validator key management infrastructure, and removing any administrative pathways that allow operators to unilaterally alter system-critical logic.

# Reviewer's Notes

⚠️ During our analysis, we identified ...

Some contracts (e.g., EthFoxVault, RewardEthToken) use ERC1967 or UUPS proxies. Upgrades are authorized by admin or \_authorizeUpgrade.

The OsTokenFlashLoans contract was excluded from the core analysis because it operates as an auxiliary component and does not influence user custody or the protocol’s upgrade paths in a way that fits within the decentralization evaluation criteria.

Because Stakewise is issuing tokens that may be used across external DeFi applications, user funds may become indirectly exposed to the risks of those external protocols. Partial withdrawals typically complete faster (≈27–28 hours), while full exits can take up to one month to finalize.

# Dependencies

StakeWise v3 relies on several operational dependencies that supply data or infrastructure essential to the functioning of the protocol.

Oracle Mechanism: The most significant dependency is the oracle network responsible for feeding consensus layer data (validator status and reward accruals) to the Keeper contract. This oracle set consists of multiple nodes selected and managed by the StakeWise DAO, with the Keeper contract configured to require a specific threshold of signatures before accepting updates. The accuracy and timeliness of rewards, as well as the recognition of exited validators, depend entirely on the honest and coordinated operation of these off-chain nodes.

Validator Infrastructure: The protocol delegates staking duties to distributed Ethereum validators. These are registered in the DepositDataRegistry and managed via the keysManager and validator root parameters. Since these validators are operated by external entities, the protocol depends on them for liveness, correct key management, and slashing prevention. Because vault accounting and OsToken redemption logic rely on the state of these validators, the protocol's performance is intrinsically linked to the reliability of these infrastructure operators.

Governance-Controlled Parameters: The protocol actively depends on the specific multisigs controlling the Redeemer and MerkleDistributor. The Redeemer defines the "baskets" of assets available for OsToken redemption, while the MerkleDistributor relies on an authorized distributor to perform complex off-chain calculations of staking rewards and submit the resulting Merkle roots on-chain. The protocol assumes these inputs are calculated correctly; if these privileged actors submit incorrect configurations or roots, user claimable balances and redemption values will be incorrect.

External Integrations: Finally, because StakeWise v3 issues transferable derivative tokens (osETH) that may be integrated by external DeFi protocols, the security of those downstream systems becomes an indirect dependency for users who utilize them. While not part of the core protocol evaluation, users should be aware that interacting with external pools or lending markets introduces risks distinct from the StakeWise smart contracts.

# Governance

## Relevant Subsection

Governance in StakeWise v3 is concentrated in a small set of multisigs that control upgrades, parameter changes and validator configuration across the system.

The StakeWise DAO multisig (4-of-7) governs the core contracts, including the Keeper, VaultsRegistry, the OsToken suite, the liquidation escrow and the reward-token logic. Through these roles it can modify oracle thresholds, update validator and reward reporting rules, adjust minting and redemption mechanics, change fee and treasury settings, whitelist or remove vault implementations and factories, and upgrade logic without delay.

Stakewise Multisig #1 governs the reward-distribution and redemption pipeline: it controls the MerkleDistributor, the OsTokenRedeemer and the MetaVaultFactory, allowing it to decide how rewards are distributed, which baskets back OsToken redemptions and how new meta-vaults are deployed.

Stakewise Multisig #2 manages the main vault-specific controls for EthFoxVault, including metadata, fee routing, blocklist administration, validator-root delegation and logic upgrades. Validator-root updates for affected vaults are executed by the separate keysManager multisig (2-of-4), while certain Keeper and registry operations can only be triggered by registered vaults that meet the protocol’s internal requirements.

Because no component in StakeWise v3 enforces timelocks or mandatory waiting periods, governance decisions take effect immediately once executed by the controlling multisig. This gives the DAO and the two Stakewise multisigs direct and continuous influence over how deposits are assigned to validators, how rewards are recognized and distributed, how vaults behave internally, how redemption baskets are structured and how the OsToken monetary policy is applied. As a result, the protocol’s operation—across validator configuration, vault logic, fees, redemptions and upgrades—remains closely tied to the actions and security of these governance actors.

|  | acceptRedeemablePositions | Accepts the proposed redeemable positions. Activates a given redemption basket. Accepting bad basket lets insiders redeem against overvalued junk. | Stakewise Multisig #1 |
|  | denyRedeemablePositions | Rejects proposals. Blocks unsafe baskets. Malicious denial can stall legitimate redemptions. | Stakewise Multisig #1 |
|  | removeRedeemablePositions | Removes active positions. Updates redemption set over time. Removing good backing harms redeemers’ options. | Stakewise Multisig #1 |
|  | transferOwnership/renounceOwnership | Starts the ownership transfer of the contract to a new account or leaves the contract without owner. Shifts or freezes power over redemption rules. Wrong owner can freeze or rig redemptions. | Stakewise Multisig #1 |
| OsTokenVaultController | transferOwnership/renounceOwnership | Starts the ownership transfer of the contract to a new account or leaves the contract without owner. Governs mint/burn & capacity of vault shares. Malicious owner can print shares or change economics unfavorably. | StakeWise DAO |
|  | mintShares | Mint OsToken vault shares. Expands vault liabilities vs backing. Over-minting dilutes backing → insolvency. | StakeWise DAO |
|  | burnShares | Burn shares for withdrawn assets. Shrinks liabilities. Incorrect burning can break accounting, reduce users balances. | StakeWise DAO |
|  | setCapacity | Sets total shares / TVL. Risk control on vault size. Too high removes safeguards; too low griefs growth. | StakeWise DAO |

|  | setFeePercent | Adjusts protocol/vault fee percent. Changes yield split. Set to extreme rates effectively seizes yield from users. | StakeWise DAO |
|  | setAvgRewardPerSecond | Updates average reward per second. Controls streaming rewards logic. Overstated rate = undercollateralization; understated = user underpayment. | Keeper |
|  | setKeeper | Sets Keeper contract. Links to oracle/harvest logic. Pointing to malicious Keeper injects bad data. | StakeWise DAO |
| EthOsTokenVaultEscrow | setAuthenticator | Updates the authenticator: address that validates operations. Adds extra auth layer. Malicious authenticator can permit invalid operations. | StakeWise DAO |
|  | updateLiqConfig | Updates the liquidation configuration. Tunes safety vs capital efficiency. Misconfig can trigger mass liquidations or allow bad debt. | StakeWise DAO |
|  | transferOwnership/renounceOwnership | Starts the ownership transfer of the contract to a new account or leaves the contract without owner. Shifts all above powers. Ownership to malicous adress = full control over liquidations/redemptions. | StakeWise DAO |
| VaultsRegistry | transferOwnership/renounceOwnership | Starts the ownership transfer of the contract to a new account or leaves the contract without owner. Controls master list of allowed vault impls/factories. Malicious owner whitelists could rogue implementations used across ecosystem. | StakeWise DAO |
